# Sonoff MQTT IoT

The aim of this project is to control multiple sonoff devices using MQTT.

The sonoff devices have all been prepped to support the [Sonoff-Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki) firmware.
This firmware provides MQTT support to the sonoff devices.

## Dependencies

The solution uses the paho MQTT java library for MQTT communication.
